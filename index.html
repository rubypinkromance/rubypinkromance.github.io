    <h1>Ruby Pink</h1>
    <h2>Erotic Romance</h2>
    <p class="lead">
        Ruby Pink lives in a small town in Washingon state,
        where she spends her days writing steamy romance.
        She loves reading erotica but gets frustrated
        that so many feature shallow women with no agency.
        She took up the pen to bring us tales of smart, talented
        ladies who aren’t just props in male fantasies.

                    <h3>Seven Minutes in Heaven</h3>
                    <h4>and other erotic short stories</h4>
                    <p>In <i>Seven Minutes in Heaven</i>, author Ruby Pink brings you 22 short, smart and saucy stories about women who know what they want. In “Teacher’s Pets,” you’ll meet the college professor who allows her students to seduce her for a better grade. In “Crowded Train,” two passengers get much closer than expected on the bumpy commute home from work. The “Winning the Bet” stories bring you two coworkers fumbling and groping their way into a relationship. You’ll meet a ghost hunter who’s willing to do whatever it takes to provoke a supernatural encounter. A tense mother who needs some physical therapy. A waitress eager to reunite with her chef. And many more.</p>
                    <p>Some stories are about couples, some about coworkers, and some about strangers. Some are sweet and loving, some are lusty and passionate. Some are written from a male perspective, but they’re all about women with their own motivations.</p>

                    <h4>Izzy knows what she wants for Christmas, but isn’t sure how to ask for it.</h4>
                    <p>A few months ago, Izzy and Paul had a huge fight — maybe the biggest of their young marriage — when she admitted she’d been flirting with Joe, the broad-shouldered grocery clerk. Her home life was in a rut, and she had blossomed under his attention. Making the decision to turn away from Joe had been difficult, but she was determined to repair her marriage.</p>
                    <p>Now Paul was trying hard to be more spontaneous, and it was helping, but something was still missing. Izzy had an idea how to reignite the heat between them, but it was a big step outside their comfort zone. Joe had mentioned once that he’d joined married couples in the bedroom before. She just needed to ask Paul for a Christmas present — something with broad shoulders…</p>

                    <p>Special Agent Gillian Reid never expected to find herself on the set of an adult film, but working at the Bureau of Paranormal Investigation can take you to some strange places. She’s come to interview a man with a strange anatomical feature that makes him doubly qualified to be a star, and has convinced her partner that he’s an alien.</p>
                    <p>Reid suspects there’s a more mundane explanation for what’s under his robe. However, when she sat down in his dressing room and started asking probing questions about his background, he got evasive. Now it’ll take all her talents to expose the hard truth of the matter, and it’s not made easier when she keeps having the most distracting thoughts. Is it getting warm in here?</p>

                    <h4>B.P.I. Box Set 1</h4>
                    <p>Even for the Bureau of Paranormal Investigation, Special Agent Gillian Reid seems to find herself in a lot of strange situations. She’s been held captive by an amorous feral shifter. She was once trapped in a ghost’s memory of his wedding night. Then there was the time a psychic matchmaker manipulated her into confessing — and then acting on — the feelings she has for her partner.</p>
                    <p>Through it all, she’s acquired a reputation as one of the Bureau’s most capable agents. When she finds herself in a situation her training never prepared her for, she uses every asset at her disposal — including her own body. Agent Reid always gets her man.</p>

                    <p>Special Agent Gillian Reid of the Bureau of Paranormal Investigation might be in trouble. She’s interviewing a man the police suspect is behind an orgy that broke out in a movie theater. They’re right, though he didn’t drug the audience as they suspected. Instead, he confesses to Reid that he’s a psychic, and he uses his abilities to encourage people to act on their more primal desires.</p>
                    <p>Now the psychic has learned that Reid and her partner have feelings for each other they haven’t expressed yet. Can she find a way to subdue this menace before his psychic matchmaking causes her to do something she’ll regret? How do you stop someone who can convince you what you’re doing is a good idea? Maybe if she can find a way to break his concentration…</p>

                    <p>Special Agent Gillian Reid of the Bureau of Paranormal Investigation has flown to Oregon to investigate a series of grisly murders. Local police blame the attacks on a wild bear, but she recognizes the signs of a feral shifter. Her suspicions are confirmed when they are attacked at the crime scene, leaving her partner knocked out and her the captive of the very man they were hunting.</p>
                    <p>But Reid isn’t the sort to give up without a fight. Maybe he has her gun and phone, and his body is made entirely of rippling muscle, but he also can’t stop staring at her chest. It’s really not fair… to him.</p>
